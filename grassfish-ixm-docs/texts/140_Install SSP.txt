==================================================

The following articles describe how to configure and install SSP in a Grassfish system. Our supply-side platform (SSP) module supports programmatic advertisement platforms which allows you to play spots provided by a third party. You can also use multiple SSPs, that means spots from more than one SSP provider. How to install SSP The following articles provide step-by-step instructions for the installation and configuration of SSP. They cover the server configuration, IXM One configuration, and player configuration. Perform all steps that are relevant for your system and skip the others. For example, if you don’t use the Windows & Linux Player, you can skip the Windows & Linux Player article. System requirements Playing SSP content requires the coordination of multiple components of your system like the IXM One, Grassfish Server, players, SSP(s), and their databases. The components are relevant for storing, transferring, and querying SSP data and, therefore, need to be compatible. The following table indicates the system requirements for all possible components in the SSP setup process. Ensure that you meet the requirements of all components that are relevant for your system. For example, if you use the Android Player ensure that you have installed IXM One and Grassfish Server version 11.14.0 or later. Product Version Additional information IXM One 11.11.0 or later You must have admin access. Grassfish Server 11.11.0 or later Android Player 11.14.0 or later The Android Player requires IXM One and Grassfish Server version 11.14.0 or later. The Android Player doesn’t require the DOOH add-on . Windows & Linux Player 11.11.0 or later DOOH add-on (DoohPlaybackService) 2.3.0 or later The Windows and Linux Player requires this add-on for SSP. The Android Player doesn’t require this add-on. To get the DOOH add-on installation package, please contact your Grassfish account manager. UDC importer (DOOHPlayBackImporter) 2.2.0 or later You need the UDC importer if you use the Windows & Linux Player with a DOOH add-on version earlier than 2.5.1. You don’t need it if you use DOOH add-on version 2.5.1 or later, or a different player. Grassfish web service (AdServingApi) 1.0.2 or later Note that you need to install version 1.1.0 or later to use multiple SSPs. .NET 6.0 If you've already installed the Grassfish Server via the installer and installed a web service on it, there’s no need to install .NET. If not, install the Windows Hosting Bundle manually from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0 An add-on is a software extension or enhancement that adds new features or functionality. UDC stands for Universal Data Controller. The UDC importer imports external data into the IXM system. UDC plugins specify which data should be imported and how it should be transformed for use by spots and players.
