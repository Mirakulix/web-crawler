==================================================

Using the detailed spot statistics, you can track which spots have been played. The player sends every single playout of the spot to the server. Based on this data, you can create a CSV file report in IXM One. Prerequisites Creating detailed spot statistics requires multiple components. Ensure that you meet the following prerequisites before you enable the setting: The CommonDataImporterPlugin is installed on the server. That means, you’ve copied all files from Server.zip\Plugins\ReportingGateway\CommonDataImporterPlugin to ReportingGateway\Pipeline\Addins. The SpotPlaytimesImporter is installed on the server. That means, you’ve copied all files from Server.zip\Plugins\ReportingGateway\SpotPlaytimesImporter to ReportingGateway\Pipeline\Addins. The generic report files are located on the server at GVServer2\GenericReports\SpotPlayTimes. This should happen during IXM One installation. Configure IXM One To enable detailed spot statistics in IXM One, perform the following steps: Navigate to the configuration files on the server at: GVServer2\www\gv2\gf\GFWebHtmlCustomer\ Open one of the following folders: 00000 : edit configurations for the entire server, which means for all customers. 000xxx : edit customer-specific settings. xxx is the customer ID. Open the config.json file in your folder with a text editor like Notepad++. Set enableDetailedSpotStatisticForUserType to one or more of the following options: Admin : admin users can access detailed spot statistics. StandardUser : standard users can access detailed spot statistics. LocationUser : location users can access detailed spot statistics. Save your changes and close the file. { "cms": { "enableDetailedSpotStatisticForUserType": [ "Admin", "LocationUser", "StandardUser" ] } } Configure the player To enable detailed spot statistics on the player, perform the following steps: In IXM One, go to the player configuration or the configuration group: For an individual player, go to Channels > Location .
