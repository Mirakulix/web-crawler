==================================================

With the Weekday Media Viewer spot, you can specify one image or video for each day of the week. That means, you can select seven media files and the system plays them on the day of the week that you assigned them to. As an example, let’s say you have screens in a hotel that provides conference rooms to companies during the work week. You want to adjust the display of content in the following way: Monday through Friday, the player displays a different video each day. Each video informs viewers about the scheduled conferences and events on the current day. Saturday through Sunday, the player displays hotel advertisement videos for regular guests. Note Please contact Grassfish for information on how to get this solution. Upload the spot Upload the Weekday Media Viewer spot to the IXM One.
