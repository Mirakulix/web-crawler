Smart signage means that content is not statically defined in a playlist but calculated based on external information on the target groups. IXM One allow you to assign target groups (tags) to contents and locations. With these tags, the contents are dynamically assigned to locations. Additionally, you can use "live tags” to specify in real time which content from the assigned pool should be displayed. Real-time content scheduling With "live tags", the content/promotion loop automatically adapts in real time. IXM One can select content based on information that it receives from external systems like data feeds or sensors such as: Age group or gender (data coming from a camera-based audience measurement system) Customer clustering (attributes coming from the POS system, providing information to set up-selling promotions) Weather (data feed from the weather data provider) For each content, you can set attributes such as, for example, "49 years+" or "Keno customer". The system uses these attributes during playback to match the trigger information that it receives. Analytics and ROI In the standard configuration, the Grassfish system provides the following playback and proof-of-play information: Number of playbacks for each content per day and screen Exact time of each playback (optional) Use of interactive applications and sensors If you use external triggers such as audience measurement systems, IXM One can also report on data from these systems and information on the selected content. For interactive applications, Grassfish provides a framework that allows the interactive applications to transmit usage data in a standardized way. Camera-based analytics tools allow you to analyse viewers. For example, the number of people looking at the screen, age, gender, or duration. This information can be matched with the displayed content to provide information about the impact of specific content. Scalable and secure system The Grassfish system is scalable and secure. It consists of the following components: IXM One: controls the content on the display Grassfish Player: displays the contents on the screen network External data suppliers (optional): project-specific interfaces, for example, for delivering weather data, news or room booking information The system structure is built as follows: Scalable from single server implementations up to distributed server cluster structures supporting tens of thousands of end devices Unlimited number of concurrent users Microsoft-based server architecture Professional MS SQL Server database Support of virtual server architectures and cloud services Optional hosting on Microsoft Azure cloud Support of multiple tenants High security level on server, player, and communication parts Successfully tested in several penetration tests Optional secure data transmission Customizable password policy rules Reporting, proof-of-play: Number of playbacks/activations of interactive applications per day and player Precise evaluation of playback time and place Evaluation of content/template use by editorial teams Note that the availability of functions depends on the software version, the hardware, and the operating system of the player.
