Get the latest version Please contact your Grassfish account manager to get the latest version. DOOH and SSP Version 12.0 11.07.2025 New features With this version we've implemented the following features: Create bookings based on budget To simplify the booking process, you can now set a budget instead of individual playback parameters. This way you don’t have to spend time on calculations or technical requirements. Simply configure your bookings by specifying a total budget and let the system calculate the playback parameters automatically. Learn more in our webhelp … Set DOOH and SSP airtime on player You can now set an airtime percentage for SSP ads in the player configuration. This complements the existing option for DOOH ads, giving you greater control over airtime allocation. Manage SSP and DOOH airtime more flexibly, ensuring consistent playback across Android, Windows, and Linux players. Learn more in our webhelp … Detailed report for multi-content spots The playback report now provides detailed insights for each video in a multi-content spot. Instead of just showing the overall number of times the container was played, you can now see the playback counts for each individual video, giving you a clearer understanding of their individual performance. Reporting is available for the Random Media Viewer and the Planned Media Viewer spot. Export DOOH chart With this release, you can export the DOOH chart as an XLSX file that you can open in Microsoft Excel. The export includes all data from the chart such as product information, booking dates and times, and the booking status. Learn more in our webhelp … Notify users about missing media You can now set up notifications to inform the sales person if a booking item without media is going to start soon. This helps ensure that campaigns are properly set up and gives you time to add media well in advance. The notification can be sent as a news center message and email. Learn more in our webhelp … Create multiple booking items with different dates You can now create multiple booking items with different dates and times at once, without leaving the booking item window. This new option allows you to easily and efficiently manage a non-continuous campaign that runs on different days. Learn more in our webhelp … Configure the SSP provider in IXM One You can now set up and manage your SSP provider directly in IXM One without having to manually edit configuration files. This simplifies and streamlines the SSP configuration process and reduces the risk of manual errors. The new SSP administration tab is easily accessible and provides all the necessary fields for SSP configuration. Learn more … Improved DOOH report calculation With this release, we’ve improved the calculation of DOOH digital reports to better reflect DOOH performance. This includes the following updates: Dynamic air time ratio : The system now uses the actual, user-configured air time ratio rather than a static value. Operating time integration : The calculation also incorporates actual operating hours, ensuring that all metrics accurately reflect real-world usage. Learn more in our webhelp … Resolved issues We’ve fixed an issue where only the waiting list was visible in the chart and the not available bar was not. Edit buttons are no longer displayed in the context menu of read-only bookings. We’ve fixed an issue where the system froze when deleting a reserved booking from a product that had another booking item on the waiting list. When clicking on “Show” next to “Includes deactivated locations”, only deactivated locations are displayed. We’ve fixed an issue where it wasn’t possible to assign categories to DOOH products. Links to webhelp English Administrator manual Standard user manual DOOH and SSP Version 11.18.0 24.01.2025 Update to 11.18.1 We recommend to update to version 11.18.1 to ensure consistency and reliability of the Player API. Update to 11.18 Note the following important information, before you update to 11.18.0. DOOH Lite: only one DOOH playlist As of this version, it's no longer possible to create multiple DOOH playlists. DOOH Lite users who have more than one DOOH playlist must review their DOOH playlists and decide how to merge or delete them. Note that this change doesn’t affect DOOH Platform users. New features With this version we've implemented the following features: Optional client number Starting with this release, you can configure whether the client number field is visible and optional. This gives you the flexibility to enter a client number when required, while ensuring one is captured for reporting purposes. Learn more … Delete bookings You can now delete bookings if you no longer need them, as long as they're not ordered or running. This will help you keep track of your bookings. Transfer only required SSP spots You can now use SSP with screen playlists so that only spots required for a specific player are transferred, rather than all SSP spots. This requires no additional configuration. You simply add the playlist ID when configuring the AdServing API as before. If this playlist is a screen playlist in IXM One and not a general playlist, the SSP spot is only transferred to the specified player. Only one DOOH playlist Since multiple DOOH playlists lead to erratic behavior in the DOOH system, it's no longer possible to create more than one DOOH playlist. If you try to do so, you’ll now see an error message. More frequent capacity calculation for deactivated locations The system now performs capacity calculations for deactivated locations every two hours instead of every 12 hours. With more timely and accurate data, it's easier to maintain current information and improve decision-making processes when working with bookings. Copy bookings As of this release, you can copy DOOH bookings. This allows you to reuse bookings easily and efficiently, simplifying your workflow and reducing redundant work. You can copy any booking regardless of its state. Use DOOH in different time zones It's now possible to use DOOH in different time zones. We've implemented measures to ensure that DOOH spots always play correctly, even if servers and players are in different time zones. Select ad spaces flexibly When creating a DOOH product, you can now select multiple locations as advertising space regardless of their hierarchical relationship - that is, regardless of the parent location. You no longer have to interrupt the selection process if you have multiple locations at different hierarchy levels. Resolved issues We’ve fixed an issue where it was not possible to save changes to a product after deleting a location from it. The “Reserved until” column in the chart is no longer empty when the booking item is on the waiting list. We’ve fixed an issue where IXM One would sometimes freeze when deleting a booking with a waiting list item. We’ve fixed an issue where a read-only text box called “Short name” appeared when creating a new DOOH product with “Generate product short name automatically” enabled. We’ve fixed an issue with the chart where both ordered and reserved bookings were present but only the reserved bar was visible. We’ve fixed an issue where reserved bookings were not displayed in the chart if they included deactivated locations. We’ve fixed an issue with the chart where the “Not available” bar was not visible in some cases. After taking a player off the waiting list, the chart now switches from “Waiting list” to “Not available”. We’ve fixed an issue where the end date of a booking item was incorrect by one hour. We’ve fixed an issue where available bookings where displayed as a bar in the chart but not listed in the booking viewer. The context menu of a selected booking now only contains buttons related to the selected element and not to the modal. For read-only bookings, the buttons in the context menu and button bar are now only for viewing, not for editing. Changing the air time ratio on a parent location no longer removes a DOOH deactivation in child locations. We’ve fixed an issue where the PlaybackDefinition.json file didn’t contain live tags and playbacks when the offline interval was low and the server not in UTC timezone. We've added a line between the bars of the DOOH chart to make it easier to distinguish their values. Users can no longer add media files and edit a spot in completed or canceled bookings. We've improved the use of different server and player time zones to avoid issues with playout times. We’ve fixed an issue where the “Visitors” field in the campaign report dialog was empty even though there were visitors.

Links to webhelp English Administrator manual Standard user manual DOOH and SSP Version 11.17.0 08.08.2024 Update to 11.17.0 Note the following important information, before you update to 11.17.0. Prepare the installation Before installing the latest version, ensure that you stop all application pools and Windows services. Don’t forget to restart them after the installation. Important changes Note the following important changes in this version. Download reports When working with DOOH playback reports, the “Download report” button is now visible by default. Make sure you have configured a report before attempting to download it to avoid errors. Updated DOOH chart display and calculation We've changed the display of the bars and the calculation of the booked percentage in the DOOH chart. This may affect how your existing bookings are displayed, even if they haven’t changed. For example, the chart no longer shows more than 100%, but a new representation of booked and reserved percentages. New features With this version we've implemented the following features: Improved workflow for lack of capacity We have improved the workflow when bookings can't be reserved due to lack of capacity. You'll now receive concrete information about which ad spaces are fully booked, during which period, and which players are affected. This will help you better understand your overall booking capacity and to make adjustments to your bookings. New button to quickly create bookings As of this version, you can easily create a new booking directly from the chart. When you show your bookings, you will now see a new button that allows you to immediately create a booking from there. This saves time and makes creating a new booking right there even easier. Updated chart display We've updated the DOOH chart to make it easier to see how much capacity is left for a booking. Thanks to a new color system and a better arrangement of bookings in different statuses, the distinction between available and unavailable time slots is now clearer at first glance. It's also easier to check if there are already bookings on the waiting list, making it less likely that a new booking will get a free spot. Automatic chart data cleanup Since outdated chart data is of little use and takes up unnecessary space in the database, we've now implemented automatic data cleansing. This new task is part of daily data maintenance and deletes chart data older than 365 days. If you want to disable the cleanup or change the retention period, please contact your Grassfish account manager. New color for digital media With this release, we’ve updated the media color scheme. The colors indicate whether a booking contains media or not and the booking status. To give you an even better insight at first glance, we’ve added gray for bookings that are complete and contain at least one digital product. This new color helps you distinguish between analog and completed digital bookings, as white now only indicates analog bookings. Improved location sorting We've improved the sorting of locations in the DOOH chart. They now appear in alphabetical and numerical order, making list navigation easier and more intuitive. See SSP spot creation date To improve usability, we've now added the creation date of SSP spots in IXM One interface. You can see it in the spot properties as well as in the selectable spots table. This helps SSP users manage their various spots more easily and keep track of old and new content. Improved explanation of booking states In our effort to continually improve the usability of our platform, we’ve taken measures to make the transition from an ordered to a running booking more understandable for DOOH users. For this purpose, you'll see a new tool tip next to the booking status when updating a booking. It explains that it can take up to an hour for the booking status to change from ordered to running. Play same advertisement back-to-back In general, the same advertisement shouldn't be played consecutively. However, if you only have a small number of DOOH spots, the system may unintentionally play too much filler content or nothing for the rest of the allocated time. To prevent this, we’ve created a new player setting to allow the same advertisement to be played back-to-back. Cleanup of deleted bookings To prevent the accumulation of old data, we've implemented a cleanup task in DataGateway that regularly removes deleted bookings and booking items. The cleanup happens during the scheduled maintenance period and after the deleted bookings have been retained for a configurable period of time. Resolved issues SSP spots are now only played back if “Prioritize programmatic advertisements“ is selected. Scrolling is now possible when the content editor is in read-only mode. It’s no longer possible to save bookings whose end time is set before the start time. The initial start date is now set to the current date when adding a booking from the chart. We’ve added a message to explain that it’s not possible to use a new product in the chart immediately while it’s being calculated. We’ve fixed an issue where the booking list wasn’t updated when selecting a different the client. Products are no longer active if they belong to a deactivated product group. It’s now possible to add a booking item that fits into the available capacity even if there is a waiting list for booking items that don’t. Media viewer spots are now compatible with Tizen 4. The “maxDate” in the chart logs is now in ISO format instead of MM/DD/YYYY. The setting "enableDoohPlaybackReportDownload" is now set to true by default. We’ve fixed an issue where AdServing API logging settings impacted performance. For better understanding, we’ve changed the name of the setting ”DOOH spots will be taken into consideration during playback” to “Prioritize programmatic advertisements”. We’ve fixed an issue where too many SSP requests were sent. We’ve fixed an issue where the share of voice percentage was not correct in the digital report. We’ve fixed an issue where the digital report didn’t show the playouts after a booking item was completed. We’ve fixed an issue where assigning multiple live tags to a product and saving caused the UI to freeze.

Resolved issues We’ve fixed an issue where the digital report didn’t show the playouts after a booking item was completed. Links to webhelp English Administrator manual Standard user manual DOOH and SSP Version 11.16.1 29.04.2024 Resolved issues We’ve fixed an issue where the DOOH Playback Importer didn't provide any data in IXM One after an update to 11.16.0. Links to webhelp English Administrator manual Standard user manual DOOH and SSP Version 11.16.0 27.03.2024 Update to 11.16 Note the following important information, before you update to 11.16: Mandatory script before update Before upgrading an IXM server with DOOH to 11.16.0 or later, you must run the following script. Previous versions contained an issue where the total provision of multiple sales persons could exceed 100%. The script will help you find critical entries that you need to correct in the database before updating to 11.16. SELECT DISTINCT BookingId, SUM(provision) as TotalProvision, COUNT(*) as SalesPeopleCount FROM [dooh].[SalesPeople] GROUP BY BookingId HAVING SUM(provision)<>100 No DOOH for location users As of this version, location users can no longer use DOOH or any DOOH-related features in IXM One. It’s no longer possible to enable DOOH for this user type. Advanced permission system With this release, we’ve updated the DOOH permissions system with new user groups. These user groups work in conjunction with the existing permissions system of IXM One. You can still set general IXM One permissions that apply to all users, such as read and write rights. In addition, you can now control who has access to which DOOH clients and bookings via new DOOH user groups. This leads to the following changes when updating to 11.16.0: The system automatically creates a default DOOH user group The default DOOH user group is automatically assigned to DOOH users at first. You can select a different group later. The default DOOH user group is automatically assigned to DOOH clients at first. You can select a different group later. New booking owner system You can now differentiate between the owner of a booking and an additional sales person. From now on, every booking must have an owner who is the primary sales person. Optionally, you can select another sales person who may receive a provision from the sales. This leads to the following changes when updating to 11.16.0: The owner of a booking now appears in DOOH reports. In the database, the owner is now included in the dooh.SalesPeople table to store their provision and to make the changes backwards compatible. Changed structure of cmsContentSummary We’ve changed the CMSContentSummary at /common/webServices/gui/user/CmsContentSummary.mjs. New features With this version we've implemented the following features: Advanced permission system We've created a new DOOH permission systemDOOH permissions system which provides a better way to control who has access to clients and bookings. A new type of user group that we’ve developed specifically for DOOH allows you to stay on top of things and manage your sales persons, clients, and bookings more efficiently. With the update to 11.16, the system automatically creates a default DOOH user group and assigns it to all existing DOOH clients and users. You can create your own DOOH user groups and assign your own DOOH user groups instead. Learn more … New booking owner system You can now differentiate between the owner of a booking and an additional sales person. The owner is the primary sales person of a booking and usually its creator. In addition, you can select another sales person who may receive a provision from the sales. Templates for simple content creation To simplify the creation of DOOH content and bookings, this release includes new and improved DOOH templates. With our ready-to-use templates, you can design and manage your content exactly how you want and create a more vibrant user experience in a few simple steps: We’ve created the new Weekday Media Viewer spot where you can select the video by weekday. The Random Media Viewer spot can now play videos in the same order as stored. The Live Tag Media Viewer spot can now play content based on categories. The Daytime Media Viewer spot can display multiple spots at selected times of the day. Learn more … New VAT solution Value added tax (VAT) may not be the same for all DOOH clients, for example if their companies are registered in another country. To provide our users with a comprehensive and global solution to this very real challenge, we have expanded our VAT settings to include the option of whether or not a customer must pay VAT. More DOOH product data Based on customer feedback, we've implemented measures to add more data to DOOH products. This allows us to help you tailor the DOOH user experience to your needs. Each DOOH product can now be customized with a new tab and fields for additional data - what data you want to add is entirely up to you. Please contact Grassfish for more information on this solution. Redesigned DOOH booking calculation With this version, we've fundamentally revised the calculation of DOOH bookings. This redesign of the calculation process allows us to maximize the performance of our platform which means that you can expect faster and more accurate processing of your bookings. Note that analog products now behave like digital products in the chart. If an analog screen is part of multiple products, the space in each product is occupied accordingly. Expanded booking list search We have expanded the search field functionality of the DOOH booking list. You can now search for a booking description, customer reference ID, agreement number, sales person, contact person, and brand. SSP audience recognition With audience recognition, you no longer have to to preset live tags in IXM One. The Windows and Linux Player can now pass live tag information to an SSP provider through the AdServing API.

We’ve changed the name of the “Locations” pane in the DOOH chart to “Locations (digital ad-spaces)”. Standard users now see the selected client’s name in the filter instead of “Do not filter”. All filter options in DOOH now work for standard users. We’ve fixed an issue where a small number of reserved bookings wasn’t displayed correctly in the chart. Users with permission "See bookings of others" can no longer add or delete a spot in other's bookings which lead to an error when trying to save. We’ve fixed an issue where using “Reserved” and “Waiting list” filters, “Waiting list” could no be deselected independently of “Reserved”.

After upgrading to 11.16.0, IXM One throws an error if you add additional data that contains at least one boolean value to a DOOH product that existed before. The player report may contain more entries than the player list in IXM One because the report only displays digital players for DOOH users, but the player list may include analog screens. Links to webhelp English Administrator manual Standard user manual DOOH and SSP Version 11.15.3 22.12.2023 New features With this version we've implemented the following features: Improved order confirmation template With this version, we've expanded the contractual terms field in the DOOH order confirmation to allow more text to be entered.

Copy booking items As of this version, you can copy booking items. This is particularly useful if you want to create multiple similar booking items without starting from scratch each time. When you copy a booking item, important values like the DOOH product, spot length, and tags are inherited from the original item. In the copied item, you can change these values as you like. Price display in the DOOH chart We’ve improved the display of prices in the DOOH chart to make the pricing easier to read and understand. For each product distribution type, there’s now an exact pricing text in the tooltip such as “Price per day per 10 sec. spot length for 100 sec. frequency”. Display of deactivated locations If a location is deactivated, for example due to renovations or repair work, it shouldn’t be booked for DOOH playouts during this time. To make it easier to work with activated and deactivated locations, IXM One now displays an info message in the booking item if there are deactivated locations and an option to show them. Set product price per year As of this version, you can set a price per year for digital and analog DOOH products that use frequency or share of voice as content distribution. This new pricing option is now available in addition to price per day, started week, and started month. Playback report for booking items With this version, you can create playback reports for booking items even if the booking isn't completed yet.

You can specify whether they receive a news center message, an email, or both in IXM One news center settings. Switch product while editing booking item You can now switch the DOOH product while editing a booking item without losing your prior changes. IXM One keeps the start date, end date, and discount that you’ve specified. Use players with display times for bookings As of this version, you can use players with configured display times for DOOH bookings with the content distributions frequency, playback, and live tag. The capacity calculation now considers the specified play times of each player. Resolved issues The price text in the product details is now correct for DOOH products with the content distribution “Playbacks” and “Live-Tags”. We’ve fixed an issue where DOOH spot playbacks were not distributed correctly over time. We’ve changed the wording in the print dialog from “offer” to “business proposal”. We’ve fixed an issue where the “Create a booking item” window didn’t open automatically in the DOOH chart. The column "Reserved until" is no longer empty when a booking is on the waiting list. It’s no longer possible to add a booking item when the booking status is ordered/ running/ cancelled/ completed or if it’s a read-only booking. We’ve fixed an issue where IXM One froze when trying to select a spot from a spot group in the booking item. It’s now possible to book a frequency based booking for more than one day with a player that has set display times. We’ve fixed an issue where a live tag booking couldn’t be booked despite enough ad-spaces. Switching the product group while creating a DOOH product no longer results in incorrect details in the “Price” tab. We’ve corrected the word “Canceled” in the booking window. We’ve fixed an issue where it wasn’t possible to open the digital report PDF. We’ve added a toast message that appears when you activate or deactivate DOOH product groups. We’ve fixed an issue in the DOOH chart where the button for adding a new booking item was sometimes disabled. We’ve fixed an issue where it wasn’t possible to make a booking for one day from 00:00 to 24:00 if “Enable reserved for bookings” was disabled. The campaign report no longer shows 0 in the field “Total number of views, purchased” even though a value has been set for target views. We’ve fixed an issue where a user with read/write rights couldn't select a spot from the spot group when creating a booking. We’ve fixed an issue where the PDF was sometimes corrupt when printing a DOOH report. Known issues The capacity check calculates the available seconds per hour to check whether there is enough space to order a booking. However, if the display times don't start and/or end at the beginning of the hour, e.g. 07:15 - 18:00, the available seconds are calculated on the hour (07:00), but the check doesn't take into account when exactly the seconds are available. After a booking has been reserved, it's possible to select a start date in the past for a booking item and order it. In the DOOH chart, the calendar week in the month and week view may start with Monday when it should be Sunday. Update to 11.15 Update plugins When you update from a previous version to 11.15, the installer updates the following plugins automatically: CommonDataImporterPlugin CommonOnlineOfflinePlayerImporterPlugin DashboardDataImporter You must manually update all other UDC and ReportingGateway (RG) plugins that you use. To update RG plugins, stop the service and exchange each required plugin folder (e.g. DoohImporterPlugin). We recommend deleting the old folder and copy/pasting the new folder instead of overwriting it. Don’t forget to restart the service afterwards. To update UDC plugins, stop the service and copy all relevant plugin files into the plugins folder. Note that there are no subfolders per plugin here. Restart the service afterwards.

The capacity calculation for these bookings now considers the specified play times for each player. That means it checks for capacity within the display times of the player. Resolved issues We’ve fixed an issue where IXM One froze when trying to select a spot from a spot group in the booking item. We’ve fixed an issue where a live tag booking couldn’t be booked despite enough ad-spaces.

It’s no longer possible to add a booking item if the status is ordered/running/cancelled/completed or in case of a read-only booking. Hotfix 2 We’ve fixed an issue where bookings with the content distribution method frequency didn’t work with players that have specific display times. Links to webhelp English Administrator manual Standard user manual Location user manual DOOH and SSP Version 11.14.0 13.02.2023 New features With this version we've implemented the following features: Improved spot selection With this version, we’ve improved the spot selection when you create a DOOH booking and add a spot. Users can now select a spot group or template group if they have the proper permission. Set airtime ratio per player or location As of this version, you can set the airtime ratio directly for players and locations. This allows you to set different percentages of screen time for advertising on a more individual level than the whole network. Change list price flexibly You can now flexibly change the list price for a booking to a higher price if this option is enabled. For example, you can easily increase the list price of a booking that is restricted to Sundays and, therefore, more expensive without having to create a new DOOH product. Add client reference ID If a client submits a reference number for a booking, you can now add it in your booking details and see it on your order confirmations. Campaign optional As of this version, the DOOH campaign field is optional. You no longer have to enter a campaign when you create a booking. New default start/end date and time As of this version, we’ve improved the default values of start/end date and time when you create a booking item. The start date is now the current date plus one and the end date is the current date plus two unless there’s a minimal booking duration or undercutting is allowed. The default start time is now 0 and the end time 24. Offer is now called business proposal As of this version, offer has been renamed to business proposal. With this new wording, DOOH adjusts to the working language of advertisers who need to be able to differentiate between non-binding business proposals and offers with a guarantee. Client number optional As of this version, the DOOH client number can be set to optional or mandatory depending on the project requirements. In addition, you can now configure that the client number is not displayed at all. Select the brand by customer The same brands often book again. To facilitate the booking data entry, you can now either select the client as brand from a dropdown list or enter the brand manually as before. Brand visible in booking info from chart When you show bookings directly from the DOOH chart, you can now see the brand in a newly added column. Report improvements To make report creation more intuitive, we’ve reduced the two previous fields “Potential contacts” and “Contacts” to one field where you can enter the number of “Visitors”. DOOH chart improvements We’ve made multiple improvements to the DOOH chart: The quarterly view now displays a full quarter instead of three months from the selected date. For example, if you’ve selected August the quarterly view displays July, August, and September. The “Price” column is now smaller, which creates more space for other columns that contain important information. When you select a product group in the chart, the products within a subgroup are now displayed in alphabetical order. This helps to find products more easily. Resolved issues We’ve fixed an issue where it was no longer possible to copy the content of a DOOH playlist. When creating a booking item, the alphabetical sorting of DOOH products in the dropdown is no longer case-sensitive. We’ve fixed missing or incorrect translations. Known issues In some cases, the price description in the product details is incorrect. The wording of "Price unit" or "Price per" may not match the selected price settings, but prices are still calculated correctly. If a newly created booking with a booking item is quickly set to ordered, the “New” button remains active. As it’s not allowed to add a new booking item to an ordered booking, trying to insert a new booking item will result in an exception.

We’ve fixed missing or incorrect translations. We’ve fixed an issue with the DOOH chart where the button to add a new booking item was sometimes not enabled. Links to webhelp English Administrator manual Standard user manual Location user manual DOOH and SSP Version 11.13.2 07.11.2022 Resolved issues In the “Ad-spaces” tab, the “Locations” pane no longer displays “Network: ROOT” but “Network: [All locations]”. We’ve fixed an issue where the price was sometimes incorrect when you added a booking in the chart. In the system parameters, the name of the selected spot group is no longer changed to “Root” after saving. We’ve changed the wording in the booking and price information window.
