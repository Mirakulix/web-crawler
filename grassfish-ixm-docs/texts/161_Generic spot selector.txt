The Spot Selector spot allows you to quickly and easily create your own spot selector and define its overall look using layout, colors, fonts, and other design options. Note If you would like to use this spot or need more information, please contact Grassfish support or sales team. System requirements This spot requires Android Player version 11.18.0 or later. Configure the player To play the spot on the Android Player, you must first configure its settings.

For a configuration group, go to Administration > Player > Configuration groups and double-click on the configuration group. In the Edit configuration group window, select Display extended modules . Under Modules , select Spotselector . Select Enable Spotselector mode . Optionally, select Spotselector battery info to display the remaining battery capacity in percent. Under Number of spot rows per playlist , select how many rows with spots you want to display. Upload the Spot Selector spot To use the spot, you must first upload the spot file to IXM One.
