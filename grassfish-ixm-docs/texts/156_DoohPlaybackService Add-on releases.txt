DoohPlaybackService Add-on Version 2.9.1 New features With this version, we’ve implemented the following new features: Safe guard We’ve implemented a safe guard in the DOOHPlaybackService add-on that checks whether processes with the same name are already running at startup. This allows us to: Prevent duplicate AdServing API requests. Stabilize system behavior in the event of system crashes. Improve overall performance and reduce the load on the AdServing API. DoohPlaybackService Add-on Version 2.9 New features With this version, we’ve implemented the following new features: Security update To fix security vulnerabilities of earlier versions, we’ve updated NuGet packages. .NET upgrade With this version, we’ve updated DoohPlaybackAddon project to .NET 8. DoohPlaybackService Add-on Version 2.8.0 - 2.8.1 New features With this version, we’ve implemented the following new features: Live tags and impressions enhancements We’ve made improvements to live tag handling and impressions. Linux ARM64 support As of this version, linux-arm64 architecture is supported. Logging improvements We’ve enhanced debug logging throughout the application. It’s now displayed whether debug logging is activated and we’ve removed redundant or unnecessary logging statements. Resolved issues We’ve fixed an issue where live tags were bypassing the cooldown mechanism. DoohPlaybackService Add-on Version 2.7.3 New features With this version, we’ve implemented the following new features: Logging enhancements We’ve improved logging messages for clarity and replaced certain log separators for consistency. Resolved issues We’ve fixed issues where the calculation of the last target playback could be stuck on previous days and adjusted reference times to ensure accurate scheduling. In addition, we’ve added debug logging for better visibility into playback calculations. To fix the live tag replacement logic, they can now be replaced by null or another spot when appropriate. This prevents non-live tags from being incorrectly placed due to recalculations, while ensuring that calculation of the last target playback remains consistent.
