==================================================

Synchronize your players to simultaneously play spots on multiple screens. This can be useful, for example, if you want to create a video wall that displays synchronized content across all screens. Synchronized players can operate in the following ways: Synchronized content with different spots Each player can play different content. The lead player controls the transition from one spot to the next. This means that all synchronized players switch to the next spot at the same time. For an optimal viewing experience, all content should be the same length. Synchronized content across all screens Create the appearance of one “big” spot across multiple screens. The individual spots start at the exact same time, controlled by the lead player. For an optimal viewing experience, all content should be the same length. System requirements and limitations Ensure that you meet the following system requirements for player synchronization: Software Android Player version 11.17.0 or later Linux Player version 11.2 or later Windows Player version 11.2 or later Tizen Player version 11.11.0 or later Your players must be set up in the IXM One. Hardware The performance of the sync depends on the performance of the hardware. You can synchronize players of each technology (Android, Windows, Linux, Tizen) with each other. However, please consider the limitations of each player. Only Linux and Windows Player 11.15 can be synchronized with Android and Tizen. The synchronized player PCs must be connected in the same local area network (LAN). We don’t recommend using a wireless network (WLAN). We have successfully tested synchronization via VPN, but your mileage may vary. Note You can't synchronize Linux and Windows Player version 11.13 with later versions. Limitations Synchronization works with different spot types and IXM One features. However, the following limitations apply: Unsupported spot types Audio Streaming Unsupported features if sync tags are not used on all spots Spot transition Playlist priority Loops Play only x spots from the playlist Shuffle playlist Synchronize players You must synchronize the lead player with the followers. You can have any number of followers. For a seamless playback, we recommend that all synchronized spots have the same length. If not, the synchronized spot playback works in the following ways: If a spot on a follower is completed before the lead player has started a new spot, the screen on the follower stays black, displays the playlist background color, or the last frame until there's a new lead spot. If a spot on the lead player is completed before a follower has finished playing it, the follower spot is interrupted and the next lead spot starts playing. How to synchronize There are different ways to configure the synchronized start of spots: complete synchronization, sync tags, or synchronized spot transition. Complete synchronization With this option, the lead player informs the followers about the next spot and when the spot changes, everyone plays the same spot. This option covers most use cases, but not video walls or special solutions. Sync tags You can assign the same sync tag to the lead spot and all follower spots that should start simultaneously. The sync tag acts as a sender of sync commands on the lead spot, and as a receiver on the follower spots. This allows you to select specific spot to start simultaneously. With this feature you can easily create a video wall. How it works Prior to the spot transition, the lead player sends a 'preload' command with the sync tag to all followers in the sync group. The followers preload the spot with the sync tag. When the lead player sends the sync command ('PlayNextSpot request), the preloaded spot starts on the follower players. Note If you want to use sync tags, you must create them in the IXM One and assign them to the desired spots. For more information, refer to the IXM One webhelp. Synchronized spot transition With this option, the lead player sends a sync command ('PlayNextSpot' request) and the next spot in the playlist starts on the follower players. This allows the simultaneous start of all spots in the sync group. However, you can’t select specific spots. This option is not supported on Tizen. How it works Prior to the spot transition, the follower player preloads the next spot in the playlist. After playing the current spot, the follower players wait for the lead player’s 'Start' command. Configure players You must configure the synchronization settings in the IXM One player configuration. The settings are similar across Windows and Linux, Android, and Tizen players, but some players have more settings depending on their capabilities. Note Lead and follower players require different settings. However, you can configure this in the configuration on the player in the same configuration group. To configure your players, perform the following steps: In the IXM One, go to the player configuration or the configuration group: For an individual player, go to Channels > Location . Double-click on your player and select Edit next to Configuration in the Edit player window. For a configuration group, go to Administration > Player > Configuration groups and double-click on the configuration group. In the Edit configuration group window, select Display extended modules . Under Modules , select Player > Sync . Setting Description define a screen of this player as sync master Specify the number of the screen that acts as lead. The first screen has number 1 . Default value: -1 (deactivated) This setting is not available on Tizen Players. define a split of this player as sync master Specify the number of the split that acts as lead: If the screen layout contains only one split, enter 0 . You can find the split number in the screen layout. Default value: -1 (deactivated) enable synced spot switch Select to enable synchronized spot transition. This setting is not required if you only want to synchronize spots with sync tags. This setting is currently not available on Tizen Players. enable synced preload for spots with synctags Select to enable synchronized preload and transition of spots with sync tags. This setting is only available on Android Players. sync group Specify a number of your choice to assign the player to a sync group. All follower players must have the same number. Default value: -1 (deactivated) multicast ip for sync communication Specify a multicast IP address that the lead player uses to communicate with its followers. In general, you can leave the default value. udp port for sync communication Specify a UDP port that the lead player uses to communicate with its followers. You can leave the default value if you only have one group of screens in your LAN. disable sync while playing events Select to disable synchronization while the lead player plays an event playlist. In this case, the followers switch to regular playback. After the event playlist has finished, the lead player sends a sync command to the followers, who return to synchronization mode. skip spots with sync tags while sync is inactive Select to not play spots with sync tags on the follower player when there is no sync command. The follower ignores all sync commands from the lead player while playing an event playlist. The setting specifies which spots will play after the event playlist is complete. The follower switches back to sync mode when it receives another sync command. heartbeat interval for sync communication Specify in which interval the lead player sends heartbeats, it only affects the lead player. The heartbeat is a signal that the lead player continuously sends to all follower players. In general, you can leave the default value. heartbeat timeout for sync communication Specify a timeout after which the synchronization is temporarily disabled if there’s no heartbeat. In this case, the follower player leaves sync mode and acts as a non-synchronized player. The heartbeat is a signal that the lead player continuously sends to all follower players. Use at least a value three-times as big as the heartbeat interval. In general, you can leave the default value. sync master priority Specify a number that determines the probability of this player to be lead player. Default value: 5 This setting is not available on Tizen Players. set sync master election algorithm Select one of the following algorithms: ID-ELECTION : automatically assigns a lead player after reboot. You can influence the selection by setting a sync master priority. Note that all players that you want to synchronize must be set to ID-Election and that this works only in stable networks. MANUAL : synchronized players elect a lead player based on sync split and sync screen settings. We recommend MANUAL for the general use case. This setting is not available on Tizen Players. distribute livetags Select to distribute live tags from the lead player to its followers. This setting is currently not supported on Tizen Players. allow synchronising all spots / enable exact spot sync using spot objects Select to allow synchronizing all spots in a playlist using the spot instance ID instead of sync tags. Sync tags are completely ignored. Note that all players must use the same program scheme. use spot objects to synchronise Select to use spot objects to synchronize all spots instead of the spot instance ID to include spots that aren’t in the current playlist of the followers, such as spots in an event playlist. Note that this must be set on all players. We strongly recommend to use this setting if you want to synchronize all spots. This setting is the default on Tizen Players and cannot be changed. Click Save to save your changes. Repeat the configuration steps for all players that you want to synchronize.
