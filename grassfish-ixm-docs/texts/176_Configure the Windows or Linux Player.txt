==================================================

Note If you use a different player, you can skip this article. Before you configure the Windows or Linux Player for DOOH, ensure that you meet the following requirements: You’ve installed the standard Windows Player or Linux Player . You’ve connected the player to IXM One. You’ve installed the latest config settings for the player on the server. Install the DOOH add-on To use DOOH on the Windows or Linux Player, you must install the DoohPlaybackService add-on . You can install this add-on from the server via an update package or locally on the player. For information on the update package, please contact your Grassfish account manager. To install the add-on manually, perform the following steps: Store the installation package in any folder on the player. Open a command prompt as administrator. To install the package, run a bootstrap command. Enter the command that matches your player's operating system: For Windows, enter: C:\GVClient\tools\current\gfBootstrap\gfBootstrap [path to]\DoohPlaybackService_version_win-x64.zip For Linux, enter: sudo/opt/grassfish/tools/current/gfBootstrap/gfBootstrap [path to]/DoohPlaybackService_version_linux-x64.zip Restart the player service or reboot the player for your changes to take effect. Install Mosquitto for MQTT The DOOH add-on communicates with the Windows or Linux Player via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). To enable this, Mosquitto needs to be installed as a broker for the MQTT protocol. For the Linux Player, MQTT is already included in the installation package by default. For the Windows Player, you can install MQTT from the server via an update package or locally on the player: For information on the update package, please contact your Grassfish account manager. To install Mosquitto manually on Windows, open the file mosquitto-1.6.9-install-windows-x64.exe from the installation package and install it. Enable MQTT To use DOOH on the Windows or Linux Player, you must enable the connection to the MQTT broker. To do so, perform the following steps: In IXM One, go to go to the player configuration or configuration group: For an individual player, go to Channels > Location . Double-click on your player and select Edit next to Configuration in the Edit player window. For a configuration group, go to Administration > Player > Configuration groups and double-click on the configuration group. In the Edit configuration group window, select Display extended modules . Under Common > Backend and select Enable connection to mWindows & Linuxt broker . Under Overseer > Tool , select Control installed mosquito service . Under Server , set accesslevel for servertoken to Standard or Full . Click Save to save your changes. Restart the player service or reboot the player for your changes to take effect. Configure DOOH settings To optionally configure DOOH-specific settings, perform the following steps: In IXM One, go to the player configuration or the configuration group: For an individual player, go to Channels > Location . Double-click on your player and select Edit next to Configuration in the Edit player dialog. For a configuration group, go to Administration > Player > Configuration groups and double-click on the configuration group. In the Edit configuration group window, select Display extended modules . Under Modules , select DOOH . Optionally, change the cool down base period (seconds ). The cooldown time for live tag spots is based on this base period. Optionally, change the cool down minimum factor (percent) . That is the base time before the same programmatic advertisement runs again. Optionally, change the cool down maximum factor (percent) . That is the maximum time before the same programmatic advertisement runs again. Optionally, change send DOOH playtimes (interval in seconds) . That is how often DOOH playtimes are sent to the server. Optionally, change cleanup local DOOH playtimes (days) . That is how often DOOH playtimes are deleted from the add-on database. Optionally, enable fill up with advertisements to fill available advertising time with random DOOH spots. This happens if there’s airtime left on the player and no other DOOH spot needs to be played back. Optionally, enable allow the same ad to play back-to-back to allow the same advertisement to play consecutively. This can be useful, for example, if you only have one DOOH spot and don’t want the system to play too much filler content or nothing at all. Optionally, switch to Logging and set the Log level to specify which notifications are collected: Debug Info Notice Warning Error Click Save to save your changes. Restart the player service or reboot the player for your changes to take effect. An add-on is a software extension or enhancement that adds new features or functionality.
