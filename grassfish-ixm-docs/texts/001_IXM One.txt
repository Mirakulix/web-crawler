==================================================

Grassfish’s IXM One allows you to manage and connect all customer touchpoints into a cohesive digital in-store experience. This comprehensive approach enables the implementation of a connected store, where visual and interactive displays, personal devices, staff devices, sensory and retail tech all work together. Evolved from a leading digital signage platform, IXM One supports the collaboration of all departments involved in creating, managing, and analyzing in-store experiences on a global scale. In this role, IXM One integrates tightly with other corporate platforms like CRM, DAM, PIM, ERP, and ECOM systems. Your browser does not support the audio element. Read more on our website. DOOH and SSP Module At Grassfish, we see a big trend towards intelligent mixes of editorial content, own advertisement, and third-party advertisement – often coming from programmatic platforms (SSPs/DSPs). In addition, Digital Out Of Home (DOOH) has become an established and fast-growing advertisement format. Advertisements on large displays and video walls are replacing traditional poster spaces everywhere. They add flexibility and motion, particularly in retail stores and public areas where you can now see screens that show a variety of content. This has opened a new revenue stream for network owners. With the DOOH and SSP module, IXM One offers an outstanding solution for supporting and combining all content and advertisement channels. You can flexibly design channel mixes as you like and the SSP integrations are transparent. Read more on our website.
