==================================================

Get the latest version Please contact your Grassfish account manager to get the latest version. Windows and Linux Player Version 11.17.1 04.07.2025 Server version At least server version 11.14 required. Note We recommend all users of version 11.15 and later to upgrade to this version. New features Qt 6.7 support With this version, we’ve updated the player framework to Qt version 6.7 and the underlying Linux operating system to better support recent hardware (Giada D612 and D613). We strongly recommend updating your player software. Please note the following information: Update if you’re using the Grassfish Linux Player on Intel 12th generation hardware or later. This player version should fix different instabilities that were reported for earlier versions. Partners reported issues with older hardware and Linux Player 11.17. We therefore strongly recommend to test before updating earlier Linux Player versions. We’re currently looking into these issues. Update if you’re using the Grassfish Windows Player. This version should fix strange behavior with the web engine like delayed, randomly flipped, or rotated spots in earlier versions. Different synchronization group for second player It's now possible to use a different synchronization group for player 2. We've added the new setting SYNC_GROUP2 to the configurator on the player, which offers the following configuration options: If this setting is set to a value greater than -1, player 2 uses SYNC_GROUP2 as the synchronization group value and ignores the existing SYNC_GROUP value. If this setting is set to the default value -1, player 2's service uses the existing SYNC_GROUP value. This was the behavior for all earlier versions. Note Note that synchronization for player 2 can't be disabled while synchronization for Player 1 is enabled. Resolved issues We’ve fixed an issue where stats.db files with playtime entries set to null prevented the player from uploading detailed spot statistics. This lead to players having accumulated spot statistics in the CMS but no detailed spot statistics. We’ve fixed an issue where some time zones that were deprecated by IANA were not working on the Linux Player. Deprecated time zones will stop being supported in a future player version. We’ve fixed an issue where the RS232 command was cut off in the log file. This issue only affected the log files. The updater no longer ignores the setting IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS. This affected servers with privately signed certificates. We’ve fixed an issue where cleanup didn’t work with Qt 11.15 and 11.17. This could lead to full disks. Windows and Linux Player Version 11.15.3 25.09.2024 Server version At least server version 11.14 required. New features With this version we've implemented the following features: Improved hardware acceleration support on Linux With this version we’ve added hardware acceleration support for 13th generation Intel CPUs to the Linux Player. Resolved issues The player now correctly accumulates player heartbeat logs before sending them to the server. We’ve fixed an issue where planned spots that were invalid could lead to a player hang. We’ve fixed an issue where a Linux Player update was impossible because of hwsupport version. We’ve fixed an issue where the player failed to upload detailed spot statistics to the server. We’ve fixed an issue where time zones were not correctly transferred from server to player. Windows and Linux Player Version 11.15.2 26.02.2024 Server version At least server version 11.14 required. New features With this version we've implemented the following features: Lubuntu update With this new player version, we’ve updated the Lubuntu operating system of our Linux Player to version 22.04.3. Some of the latest CPUs require this player version since they’re incompatible with version 11.13 (Intel 12th generation). Framework updates We’ve upgraded many libraries and frameworks on which our players depend to newer versions. This is the biggest player update since two years. Player API compatibility Grassfish Player 11.15 is not compatible with IXM server versions prior to 11.14. Provisioning From this player version on, Grassfish provisioning which facilitates the setup of new players is used by default. If you prefer to use the traditional Grassfish InitBox, simply press F10 as indicated on the provisioning landing page. Provisioning should be available on the latest IXM servers, otherwise ask your Grassfish partner. New synchronization protocol Grassfish Player 11.15 uses a slightly different synchronization protocol. Therefore, it can’t synchronize with previous Grassfish Windows and Linux Player versions. However, you can synchronize Grassfish Windows and Linux Players 11.15 with the Tizen Player from version 11.10. Resolved issues Wireless on Mele Quieter 3C players is now supported. Log rotation on Lubuntu 22.04 now happens daily instead of weekly. Known issues On Mele Quieter 3Q players, the reboot fails sometimes. As a workaround, perform a power cycle. The problem is not reproducible on Mele Quieter 3C systems. Windows and Linux Player Version 11.13.9 02.09.2024 Server version At least server version 11.11 required. New features With this version we've implemented the following features: Use server regex for Box-IDs The Windows and Linux Player now uses server regex for Box-IDs. This ensures that the regex is valid on both the player and the server. Exclude add-on logs Windows and Linux Players write their own logs. Player add-ons also write logs that appear within the player logs. If you want to avoid a high number of log entries, you can now exclude add-on logs from the player logs via a new configuration . Resolved issues We’ve fixed an issue where the screen controller didn’t stop the player after reboot if operating times were off, especially if the services started delayed. Windows and Linux Player Version 11.13.8 20.08.2024 Server version At least server version 11.11 required. Resolved issues We’ve fixed an issue where the players could not download content from servers with new certificates if SSL authentication was set. Windows and Linux Player Version 11.13.6 03.05.2024 Server version At least server version 11.11 required. Resolved issues We’ve fixed an issue on Windows where the second player didn’t start even though the display times were set for player 1 and 2. Windows and Linux Player Version 11.13.5 04.10.2023 Server version At least server version 11.11 required. New features With this version we've implemented the following features: WiFi drivers for Mele Quieter 3C hardware We’ve added WiFi support on the Linux Player for new Mele devices. The required driver is now included in the player image. Improve handling of incompatible add-ons We have implemented a feature that allows the system to detect incompatible add-on versions and accordingly print a log message. InitBox change on Linux Similar to the behavior on Windows, network settings on Linux are made through the OS again, the new network settings will be available again in player version 11.15. Resolved issues We’ve fixed UDP streams on our Windows Player. Windows and Linux Player Version 11.13.3 17.07.2023 Server version At least server version 11.14 required. Resolved issues We’ve fixed an issue where the screen resolution was sometimes incorrectly detected after a nightly reboot. This issue was originally reported for Windows players. We’ve fixed an issue where ZIP files containing Grassfish widgets in some cases could not be downloaded again on Windows after a server box reset. Windows and Linux Player Version 11.13.2 30.05.2023 Resolved issues We’ve fixed a regression in 11.13 where the X/Y coordinates and size were being ignored for a screensaver event playlist displayed as an overlay. Windows and Linux Player Version 11.13.1 30.01.2023 Resolved issues We’ve fixed an issue where SharePoint spots didn’t work because the relevant cookie was not forwarded to the WebEngine. Windows and Linux Player Version 11.13.0 11.11.2022 New features With this version we've implemented the following features: New InitBox With this version, we’ve implemented a new InitBox with new network settings, new audio settings, and support for future Grassfish provisioning. In addition, the InitBox has a new and updated look. Automatic player setup during silent installation If you perform a silent installation on Windows, you can now pass the server hostname, Box ID, and HTTPS connection via command line. To do so, simply write the values into an INI file. The InitBox checks this file and starts the initialization if the provided data is correct. If the data doesn't work, the InitBox appears, and you can correct the data. Improved F2, F3, and F8 windows As of this version, we’ve improved the F2 and F3 windows and we’ve revised the F8 window’s positioning and its elements. New filter field in gfConfigurator You can now use a new field in the gfConfigurator to filter which settings are visible. This helps you to easily navigate the available settings and quickly find what you are looking for. You can filter for keys as well as setting names and descriptions. To facilitate the search for settings across tools, we’ve added an option to search all modules in the tool selection. Log info about RS232 device in use If your display is controlled via RS232 and a USB-to-Serial adapter, the screen controller can now display the vendor ID, product ID, and serial number of the adapter in the log file. Configure transparency on the player We’ve added a new player configuration that makes the player background and the background of all playlists completely transparent. To configure transparency, just set the new setting WINDOW_TRANSPARENT to true. This applies to Windows and Linux players. Log ActionList entry in human readable form With this version, ActionList entries are logged as a readable string like “GetContentFiles” in the InternetReceiver. This facilitates working with log entries because they’re easier to read if they’re not just numbers. Disable InitBox settings You can now disable the network, audio, and keyboard settings in the settings file presets/os.ini. Resolved issues We’ve fixed an issue where the player didn’t center PDFs correctly. We’ve fixed an issue that occurred in 11.12.0 where the overlay didn’t display any content when event playlists were triggered. We’ve fixed an issue where the player froze for an instance every 30 seconds if the ScreenController was started. We’ve fixed an issue where if the Overseer service was stopped, updating any service in the CMS forced the InternetReceiver service to restart. We’ve fixed an issue where player 2 didn’t start reliably on Windows.
